Memory Tile Game

Rules/Instruction:

The purpose of this game is to match two tiles with each other. The game begins with a menu displaying "START" or "QUIT". On "QUIT' game closes, on "START" the game immediately begins. Each game contains 5 lives, once the user fails to answer five times the game will display: "GAMEOVER.". Each level also contains a timer, which allows the user to see the tiles before they are covered. Each level passed brings the user into another level (each level increments by 2 new colors (4 blocks)).However, the last level is the final stand! The tiles double from 2 new colors to 4 (8 new blocks). Once the user successfully completes the game, the user will be prompted with a "YOU WIN!". 


Bugs/Possible Issues:

Within the game itself the user should allow roughly 1 second in between guesses. Since the game contains a 1 second sound effect for correct/incorrect guesses, the game needs the effect to be completed or else the game will freeze. Clicking quickly will also cause the sound effects to bug out. Lastly, the user must download and add the sound files to the game or it will not run.

Extra features: 

The only extra features that were not mentioned in the write-up were the implementations of the sound effects.


Workload:

The workload from the beginning of the project to the end was very different. At first we tried to split the work amongst each other, but we kept overwriting previously written code. After the countless hours wasted, we decided to build from each others code. Although it was tedious waiting for each others submission, it ended up working out.
