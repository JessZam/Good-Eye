# Good-Eye
Memory/Matching card game.

The purpose of this game is to match two cards with each other. The game begins with a menu displaying "START" or "QUIT". On "QUIT' game closes, on "START" the game immediately begins. Each level contains 5 lives, once the user fails to answer five times the game will display: "GAMEOVER". Each level also contains a timer, which allows the user to see the tiles before they are covered. Each level passed brings the user into another level (each level increments by 2 new colors (4 blocks)). Once the user finishes the game, the user will be prompted with a "CONGRATULATIONS".
